The default duration for this function is 5, because the dataset used for pre-training of the transformer had average length between 4 and 5 seconds for each audio utterance ([source](https://sail.usc.edu/iemocap/Busso_2008_iemocap.pdf)). \n","\n","The load function from the librosa library converts the audio file into a numeric array before the data can be passed into the transformer pipeline. The default sample rate is set to 16000 for the librosa.load function, as this was used for the model pretraining.\n","\n","The transformer pipeline is then defined for our audio classification task of sentiment analysis, with a specification to utilize available GPU's (as device is set to 0). An empty list is next initialized for storage of sentiments. \n","\n","Looping over the set of defined start points, sentiment analysis is conducted on each audio chunk. Sections of the array developed by librosa (defined as y in the function) are put through the transformer pipeline to output a dictionary of probabilities for each sentiment (happy, angry, sad, or neutral). The dictionary of probabilities is appended to the sentiments list and the process repeats until all chunks of the audio's tensor have been classified. \n","\n","Finally, the remaining code converts our sentiment list of dictionaries into a dataframe with columns for each sentiment score, in order of the earliest to latest audio chunks. \n","\n","***The current function does not follow best coding practices and currently takes hours to run for our entire 2021 Q4 dataset. For quick results, the function should remove the librosa.load function. Instead, parallel processing should be used on librosa.load for each file of interest to develop a dataset of arrays. These arrays could be directly loaded into the pipeline and significantly reduce the runtime for future use.
